            Choose from a range of Stacks and tiles provided to you for free. Browse 
            Stacks and tiles and mark those you particularly like as your favourites. 
            Customise tiles at any time and arrange your Stacks to suit your particular 
            needs. Create new Stacks for your users, either from scratch or building on 
            Stacks brought to you by the Tilestore. And share them with your colleagues 
            and the wider world. Create QR codes so others can quickly find your Stacks. 
            Using these QR codes, you can also link your Stacks to locations, machines, 
            tools or any other physical element so that others can get them where and 
            when they need them. We also provide you with a push messaging feature to 
            keep in touch with your users.
